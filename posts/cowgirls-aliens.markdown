A fact that you probably already guessed: I start a lot more blog posts than I finish.
In recent years, this has happened to a degree that is no less than tragic. Back when
<cite>Cowboys & Aliens</cite> was still a newly released movie, I wrote 90% of a scathing
critique of its shortcomings; a spiritual successor to
[my piece on <cite>Avatar</cite>](http://blog.iangreenleaf.com/2010/01/avatar-and-fetishizing-other.html).
Then I stalled out on finding a good way to wrap it all up, life got in the way, and I
never finished. The piece was consigned to a virtual basement crawl space with only
virtual dust bunnies for company.

Fast forward to several months ago, when I connected with an awesome new website called
[Dilettante Army](http://www.dilettantearmy.com/) (go read
[their explanation of the name](http://www.dilettantearmy.com/about), it's great).
Not only did they _like_ my piece, they even _paid_ me for it! Never before have I been
compensated for the effort I put into expressing opinions on the Internet.

You should check out their whole site. But most of all, you should check out
[my article on <cite>Cowboys & Aliens</cite>](http://www.dilettantearmy.com/rants/243).

<blockquote>
It was the summer blockbuster boasting such a talented roster that we
dared to hope it would transcend the cheesy premise. It didn’t. Still,
if you only viewed it as a shallow and forgettable action flick, you
missed out. It’s also a treasure trove of scriptwriting ignominy; a
guided historical tour through Hollywood’s various failures of
imagination.

Fun bonus fact: While gathering images for the article, I realized I could very easily compile an entire photo album on the theme "Ella gazing at Jake". Run with that as you will.
